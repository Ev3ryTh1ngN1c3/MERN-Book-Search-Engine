## Description

This project is a MERN stack single-page application that allows users to search for books using a GraphQL API. <br>
The application uses React for the front end, GraphQL with a Node.js & Express.js server for data retrieval, <br>
MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for the database & JWT for authentication. <br>
The UI is polished, responsive & interactive, providing a seamless user experience. <br>
The repository follows best coding practices.

## User Guide

## Project Motivation

This project motivation was to provide a real-world application that demonstrates the use of a MERN stack <br>
(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) in building a full-stack single-page application.<br>
Overall, the motivation behind this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience in building a modern,<br>
data-driven & user-focused application using the MERN stack, while also preparing to showcase skills.

## What Was Learned

This project offered a comprehensive learning experience that covers various aspects of full-stack application <br>
development, including technology integration, database management, user authentication, deployment, UI/UX design, <br>
problem-solving & portfolio building.
